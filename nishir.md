Dearest beta,

It’s hard to imagine what my life would be like for the last 4 years if I didn’t meet you at the ACM meeting. Probably fine tbh. BEEETCH

CECS. Beatboxing. Broadway. SNL. That GoT Telltale game. Conquest. SpringFest. The first stop at Embarcadero Station at the Hyatt. Our long handshake that you can never remember. Gandhi. CFA after EE (or when we’re lazy at Tuscany). Those random Webb events. Festival of books. Seeing celebs. That p lit 21st bday party at Tuscany. Smorgasburg. Baking things. Spilling the tea. Just fun in general. This has been an incredible ride, and I have learned so much from you and laughed too hard at your impeccable impressions and the ridiculous things you say. Thanks for entertaining me and actually being funny and keeping me sane (or driving me insane) – I will miss our kikis and all the lingo we’ve exchanged with each other. Just like how the Hacktech guy would phrase it, “besties 5 lyfe!”

Here is a link to ALL the photos and videos I have of you on google photos. I think this collection of pictures will do a better job at capturing our joy and crackheadedness throughout the past 4 years than words will.

Let’s stay in touch, and I’m crossing my fingers for us living in the same city again. The show must go on, and our handshake needs more silly additions. 

Love,
Ethan
