Using crazy amounts of extrusion and special duplications, I modeled this UFO to create a contrast in conventional and unconventional designs. I used different Maya Arnold textures to present a metallic look on my model and rendered the final frames in Arnold RenderView. I put together the frames into a video using Adobe AfterEffects (around 120 frames).
