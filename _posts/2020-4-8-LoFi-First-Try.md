My friend Jackie and I spent the night creating our first Lofi song as we aim to become the top Spotify artist for Lofi songs. Our first 30 seconds of the song include a beatbox routine, piano tunes, and a dialogue that captures the plight of students who just took a test. We recorded the different tracks from an electric piano and our mouths, and edited this on GarageBand (:lol:) â€“ should probably use FL Studio next time.
