Using crazy amounts of extrusion and special duplications, I modeled this UFO to create a contrast in conventional and unconventional designs. I used different Maya Arnold textures to present a metallic look on my model and rendered the final frames in Arnold RenderView. I put together the frames into a video using Adobe AfterEffects (around 120 frames).

After using NukeX's camera tracking feature on the composition of a scene taken above LA, I imported that camera, image planes, and the UFO models into Maya and animated the UFOs with respect to the camera and the different buildings in the scene. I also incorporated lighting in the composition to create shadows from the UFOs casted onto the city. The final animation will be rendered using Arnold.
