I grew up in Taiwan and Shanghai, where I went to a school that was founded by and, sadly, named after a semiconductor foundry. I studied computer engineering, computer science, and [3D animation](https://vimeo.com/user74372618) at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu), where I also took part in leading hardware projects at [Makers](http://viterbimakers.usc.edu/), playing as a varsity member and the Vice President of the [USC Table Tennis Team](https://www.facebook.com/uscpingpongposse/), and developing software for non-profits and local communities at [Code the Change](https://www.ctcusc.com/). I also worked on [deep learning inference](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) and [robotics](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/robotics/) solutions at NVIDIA, and now I work on [robotics products](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/industries/robotics/) at NVIDIA.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching, learning, and [writing](https://medium.com/@ethanyu/beatboxing-resources-compilation-bbdb0364023a) about beatboxing; building random projects at [hackathons](https://devpost.com/EthanY); watching and writing stand-up comedy routines; and trying out different older video games that were on sale.
