Hi! My name is Ethan Yu, and I grew up in Taiwan and Shanghai, where I went to a school that was founded and, sadly, named after a semiconductor foundry. I studied computer engineering, computer science, and [3D animation](https://vimeo.com/user74372618) at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu), where I also took part in leading hardware projects at [Makers](http://viterbimakers.usc.edu/), playing as a varsity member and the Vice President of the [USC Table Tennis Team](https://www.facebook.com/uscpingpongposse/), and developing software for non-profits and local communities at [Code the Change](https://www.ctcusc.com/). I also worked on [deep learning inference](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/) and [robotics](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/robotics/) solutions at NVIDIA.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching and learning beatboxing. If you are ever interested in
getting started on learning beatboxing but have no idea how, check out this [link](https://medium.com/@ethanyu/beatboxing-resources-compilation-bbdb0364023a)!

I've also been to a fair amount of hackathons. I have explored the intersections between web development, augmented reality, motion-detecting hardware, and 3D computer graphics â€“ things get pretty wild when you mix and match these different domains.
