Hey there!
I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science (with an interest in Robotics) at the University of Southern California. I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering at USC in December 2019.

I'm currently interested in AI solutions (especially deep learning) and robotics. This summer, I will be working on robotics solutions @ [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/robotics/). Last summer, I was working on deep learning inference optimization and runtimes @ [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/).

At school, I am a part of these student organizations:
- [Makers](http://viterbimakers.usc.edu/): I'm a project manager and an engineer
- [USC Table Tennis](https://www.facebook.com/uscpingpongposse/): I play on the Varsity team, coach junior
and experienced players, and manage the club as Vice President
- [Code the Change](https://www.ctcusc.com/): I was a software developer

In my spare time, I enjoy watching and learning beatboxing. If you are ever interested in
getting started on learning beatboxing but have no idea how, check out this [link](https://medium.com/@ethanyu/beatboxing-resources-compilation-bbdb0364023a)!

I've also been to a fair amount of hackathons. I have explored the intersections between web development, augmented reality, motion-detecting hardware, and 3D computer graphics â€“ things get pretty wild when you mix and match these different domains. Check out my [Devpost](https://devpost.com/EthanY) for my projects portfolio and awards!

Besides America, I have also lived in Taiwan and China (specifically Shanghai) for a while.
