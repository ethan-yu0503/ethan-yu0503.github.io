Hey there!
I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science (with an interest in Robotics) at the University of Southern California. I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering at USC in December 2019.

I'm currently interested in AI solutions (especially deep learning) and robotics. This summer, I will be working on robotics solutions @ [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/robotics/). Last summer, I was working on deep learning inference optimization and runtimes @ [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/).

At school, I am a part of these student organizations:
- [Makers](http://viterbimakers.usc.edu/): I'm a project manager and an engineer
- [USC Table Tennis](https://www.facebook.com/uscpingpongposse/): I play on the Varsity team, coach junior
and experienced players, and manage the club as Vice President
- [Code the Change](https://www.ctcusc.com/): I was a software developer

I've also had the opportunity to work with people from USC's [Robotics Embedded Systems Laboratory (RESL)](https://robotics.usc.edu/resl/) and [Interactive and Collaborative Autonomous Robotics (ICAROS)](http://icaros.usc.edu/).

Outside of computer science and engineering, I have also dabbled in computer animation, fascinated by the intersection between technology and art. I had the chance to learn about visual effects, crowd generation, motion capture, modeling, and basic rigging and apply it to some of my [projects](https://vimeo.com/user74372618)! 

In my spare time, I enjoy watching and learning beatboxing. If you are ever interested in
getting started on learning beatboxing but have no idea how, check out this [link](https://medium.com/@ethanyu/beatboxing-resources-compilation-bbdb0364023a)!

I've also been to a fair amount of hackathons. I have explored the intersections between web development, augmented reality, motion-detecting hardware, and 3D computer graphics â€“ things get pretty wild when you mix and match these different domains. Check out my [Devpost](https://devpost.com/EthanY) for my projects portfolio and awards!

Besides America, I have also lived in Taiwan and China (specifically Shanghai) for a while.
